# eval_metrics

Precision and Recall are important evaluation metrics to use when evaluating the performance of a binary classification model. 
However, they may not be the best indicators of model performance, especially when the prior distribution of the positive and negative classes differ.
Here, they are explored in more detail and compared to the Matthew's Correlation Coefficient, which is invariant to the prior distributions of the data.
